            <h1>nyc week 1</h1>
            <p> Seeing lovers do moves </p><p>
                Snowing on Sumin </p><p>
                My sister says she doesnt understand friendship </p><p>
                And i get it, </p><p>
                Refusal as a process is interesting, </p><p>
                We should say no more often. </p><p>
                Ignorance is bliss, </p><p>
                Ronica says she is an ignorance artist, </p><p>
                And in some ways yes, </p><p>
                The less I know the better. </p><p>
                What does it mean if am committed to being misunderstood? </p><p>
                My sister is an orthodox computer scientist. </p><p>
                surrenders herself to the transcendent knowledge of physical computing</p><p>
                We were never meant to understand everything, </p><p>
                “Comprehensive understanding is a myth” </p><p>
                And maybe she didn’t actually say that. </p><p>
                </p>   
                <br>
                their familiarity is heavy</p><p>
                And yet the snow is light </p><p>
                luke sechrest helps her find a ride home</p><p>
                maybe the mystery is sometimes just a means to manipulate</p><p>
                im trying to be reverent towards my art objects</p><p>
                any relationship is not one i should take for granted </p><p>
                <br>
                i have some questions</p><p>
                Is understanding as an act of care always violent? </p><p>
                How can you take care of something you don’t know?</p><p>
                Mierle Ukeles speaks of care and maintenance </p><p>
                I wrap my headphones in such a way which lengthens their lives</p><p>

                The cloud is just another persons computer</p><p>
                but/and maybe we can never escape our lives, or paying rent.</p><p>
                <br>
                Moten says “Like Deleuze. I believe in the world</p><p>
                and want to be in it. </p><p>
                I want to be in it all the way to the end of it because </p><p>
                I believe in another world</p><p>
                in the world </p><p>
                and I want to </p><p>
                be in that.” </p><p>
                websites are physical, and maybe the physical abstractions are just as </p><p>
                fake as transcendent ones, </p><p>
                but <a href="./week1page.html">understanding that takes time.</a> </p><p>
